Q: Exercise 2.1.2.2. Here is a simplified account of how the brain receives light. The eye
contains about 100 million photoreceptor (PR) cells. Each connects to a retinal ganglion
(RG) cell. No PR cell connects to two different RG cells, but usually many PR cells can
attach to a single RG cell.
Let P R denote the set of photoreceptor cells and let RG denote the set of retinal
ganglion cells.

a.) According to the above account, does the connection pattern constitute a function
RG -> PR, a function PR -> RG or neither one?
b.) Would you guess that the connection pattern that exists between other areas of the
brain are “function-like”?

A:
  a. PR -> RG
  b. Yes!
